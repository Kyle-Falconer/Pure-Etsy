Pure-Etsy
=========

This project is a coding evaluation, given the following requirements:
 
* Using [Pure](http://purecss.io/), develop a page template for the [Etsy homepage](http://www.etsy.com/).

* This does not have to be a perfect clone of the Etsy page, feel free to include your own design elements. This should be a single page of html using Pure components like base, grids, forms, menus etc. You will also need to include an additional css file (that extends Pure) that will customize the look and feel of this page (see the templates listed above for examples).
